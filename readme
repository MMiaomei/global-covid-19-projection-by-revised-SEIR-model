This revised SEIR model is based on the paper: 
曹盛力,冯沛华,时朋朋.修正SEIR传染病动力学模型应用于湖北省2019冠状病毒病（COVID-19）疫情预测和评估[J/OL].浙江大学学报(医学版):1-13[2020-04-14].http://kns.cnki.net/kcms/detail/33.1248.R.20200303.1722.004.html.
It can be used to project the daily infected people in the global or in Hubei province. There are a lot of flexible parameters that can be adjusted. So, the projection result is only used for estimating the strictness of the quarantine on the  trend of COVID 19, instead of estimating the exact number of the future patients.
